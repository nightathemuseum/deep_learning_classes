mnist_dnn.py: A simple deep neural net using Keras & Tensorflow. The model was trained on the MNIST dataset and classifies a black background, grayscale handwritten digit (28x28 pixels) with about 96% accuracy.


mnist_cnn.py: Very similar to the mnist_dnn above, but restructures inputs to use convolution layers. Based on the LeNet CNN architecture. Accuracy of about 98%, but could still use some improvement (not very accurate for off center letters, thin strokes, etc).
